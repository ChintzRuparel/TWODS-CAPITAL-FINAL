The process by which an investor reduces the risk by adding more companies to his/her portfolio is what diversification is all about. Investing has some major core concepts which includes mental stability (patience to see losses), Diversification etc. While diversifying a portfolio, an investor should be cautious about not over-diversifying the portfolio. Once you add more than a certain number of stocks, it becomes very difficult to breakeven on day-to-day basis. Holding multiple sectoral stocks can hamper your growth to your dream portfolio. Hence diversification is of utmost importance when investing a large chunk of money into equity markets. As an investor, you can use multiple investment instruments like Mutual Funds, Bonds, and Commodities etc.\n\n\n\nPoint Five - Stick to your roots\n\nThis might be one of the most important aspects of investing. Understanding markets might be tough but sticking to your rules and investing framework will be way more complex than understanding markets. The market overall in the past of couple of years have been very uncertain and this was time most of the retail investors have got in. The wave of pandemic and rising inflation have made the market tricky and uncertain. In such time of high volatility and quick changing sentiments sticking to your rules and Investment framework. Investment framework is a set of investor defined rules to invest in the markets and fetch hefty returns. Creating an Investment/trading framework differs from person to person based on their risk profile some can risk it all while some are afraid to even take a small bet. Another thing to take care of is Stick to your views. Remember that day on drinks you told your friend that I will never invest in penny stocks – Yes so just stick to that you’re doing the right thing. Sticking to your investment framework just won’t make you a profitable trader it will make and educated and disciplined trader.\n\n\nPoint Six - F&O is the only way you can be poorer || Hedging is the only way you'll be Wealthier\n\nFutures and Options is a different segment of market here traders hold the position from a few seconds to a few week. In this segment there is a minute or no resemblance of fundamentals, technical here are the main deciding factor here. Futures are considered quite stable as they are prices similarly as the stock. Options are the more lethal ones here. Options are highly unstable and exceedingly volatile. The price the trader pays for buying an option is called the premium. The premiums of options can shoot up 300%-500% or even deplete 90-95% on major gap-ups and gap-downs. Majority of the new age traders often take naked positions in them and often loose a huge ton of their capital. Hedging refers to have a long position (Bullish Position) in one segment and countered by a short position (Bearish Position) in another segment. Hedging is a risk management method used by options trader to hedge their risks against non-favouring position. Naked trading is often a retails go to spot to trade. Options are always called leveraged positions because a trader has to buy a certain quantity known as the lot size. Hence these high leveraged positions are often poisonous to your portfolio. Hedging might be the best way you can have a chance to make money in this sect of the market. Hedging doesn’t make you a good trader, it makes you an educated one.\n\n\n\nPoint Seven - Follow Strict Targets and Stop Losses!\n\nA good Risk Management system is of utmost importance when trading. A good Risk Management System includes – Variable Stop Losses and Targets. Stop Loss is a form of trigger order which is triggered at a certain price point. For Example if you have placed a Stop Loss order of selling Reliance Industries to sell the script at 2500-levels then the software will sell your position once the price is triggered. A 10% Stop Loss on a position less than INR 50,000 is considered healthy. A trailing stop is a type of stop loss which changes with price action. Trailing stop losses are a part of a greater profit making strategy. As compared to stop loss, we also have something called as Targets. Targets are price where the investor/trader thinks that the scripts has been valued appropriately. While stop loss orders are price triggered orders, targets are sentimental levels. Targets are not set on a computer software but are studied and developed in an investor/traders mind. Following your set of targets and stop losses are beneficial to your finances. You can change your stop losses according to the price action but manipulating with stop losses on the pretext of greed would be felonious. In the words of great American Financier Bernard Baruch, “In investing/trading it’s not how much you make but rather how much you don’t lose.”\n\n\nThis brings us to the end of the common mistakes made by new age investors and their solutions. The exponential rise of investors is likely to continue for the next decade and it’s too likely that the retail will dominate it. In the United States of America, 50% of the Adult population invests in stock market because of minimal or null interest rates as compared to India it is just 3% of the Adult Population invests in. With the sudden development of streamline and easy to use B2C trading apps it has helped everyone to capture markets extremely easy. The next 7-10 year of the India Inc. will be the years of the retail investors hence making them caution about all the contingency risk was of utmost importance.\n\n\nThanking You!\n\n(“I, Chintan
